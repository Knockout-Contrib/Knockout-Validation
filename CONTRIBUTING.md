#Interested in Contributing?
Thanks for your interest! If you have any questions feel free to add an issue to the repo.

##Join the Knockout.Validation Team
Firstly, I am looking for team members! The popularity of Knockout.Validation has become a bit more than I can handle purely in my own sparetime, and so I am looking for folks who want to help fix bugs, add features, and generally keep the Issue list at bay.

As a team member, you will have priority on determining the direction of Knockout.Validation. You will also get credit on all publicity, articles, references, etc... for Knockout.Validation.

If you are interested, shoot [Eric](https://github.com/ericmbarnard) a note

##Found a bug?
1. Please give your absolute best attempt to repro the issue with a test (it's really not that hard)
2. Fix the bug
3. Create PR to either Master, or the next upcoming release branch (eg: if there's both a 'Master' and 'v2.1' branch - create the PR against the 'v2.1' branch)

##Want to add a feature?
1. Attempt to at least start a discussion about the idea before coding it up
2. If it seems to get decent feedback, then go ahead and start building something
3. Create TESTS! It won't get merged if it doesn't have tests!
4. See #3 about creating a PR for the code you have written

###A Note about Line Endings, etc...
- I've added a .gitattribute file to try and force line-endings to be the same across repos. Some folks use Windows, some Mac, some Linux... I don't really care, but try not to screw up the repo formatting when doing PR's. Look at the .gitattributes and make sure you aren't breaking the mold.
